## 🎬 Act I — The Premise

*Somewhere on your drive sit dozens of games, spread across Steam, Epic and Ubisoft Connect, each with its own DLL layout and its own DLC list.*

**CreamInstaller** finds every installed Steam, Epic (including **Heroic**) and Ubisoft game on your computer, along with each game's DLC-related DLL locations. It then queries **SteamCMD**, the **Steam Store** and the **Epic Games Store** for the DLCs of the games you select. All of that information lands in one simple interface for installing, configuring and removing DLC unlockers.

The main job is to **generate and install DLC unlocker configs automatically** for whichever games and DLCs you choose. Right-click any entry for more:

| 🖱️ Right-click action | What happens |
|---|---|
| 🔧 **Repair** | Repairs the Paradox Launcher |
| 📝 **Open appinfo** | Opens parsed Steam / Epic appinfo in Notepad(++) |
| 🔄 **Refresh** | Re-queries Steam / Epic appinfo |
| 📂 **Open folders** | Opens the root game directory and important DLL directories in Explorer |
| 🌐 **Open links** | SteamDB, ScreamDB, Steam Store, Epic Games Store, Steam Community, Ubisoft Store and official game websites |

## ⚡ Act II — The Arsenal

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧠 Smart discovery
- Scans **Steam**, **Epic Games**, **Heroic** and **Ubisoft Connect** libraries
- Downloads and installs **SteamCMD** by itself when a Steam game is selected
- Gathers and caches appinfo (name, buildid, listofdlc, depots…) for **every** DLC

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🛠️ One-click install & revert
- Installs DLLs and generates configs for **SmokeAPI**, **CreamAPI**, **ScreamAPI**, **Uplay R1** & **Uplay R2** Unlockers, optionally through **Koaloader**
- Cleanly **uninstalls** all of the above
- Repairs the **Paradox Launcher** automatically after launcher updates

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🎨 Comfort features
- 🌙 **Dark mode**
- 🔤 Sort the game list by name
- 🛡️ Block protected games
- 🧹 Clear the cache and reconfigure SteamCMD from **Settings**

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧪 For tinkerers
- **Test Game Generator** for Steam / Epic / Ubisoft App IDs
- Debug log window
- Unlocker DLLs are embedded in the binary, so **nothing else needs to be downloaded**

## 🎥 Act III — Lights, Camera, Install

### 📦 Installation

```text
1. Download   →  CreamInstaller.zip from the latest release
2. Extract    →  CreamInstaller.exe, anywhere you like (single-file executable)
3. Run        →  that's it
```

<div align="center">

[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/⬇%20Download-Latest%20Release-ff8a00?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/ubden/CreamApi-CreamInstaller/releases/latest)
[![.NET Runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires-.NET%209%20Desktop%20Runtime%20(x64)-512BD4?style=for-the-badge&logo=dotnet)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)

</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CreamInstaller ships as a single executable, but it **depends on the [.NET 9 Desktop Runtime (x64)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)**. If the program doesn't launch, install that runtime first.

### 🎬 Usage: the scene-by-scene script

| Scene | Action |
|:---:|---|
| **1** | Launch `CreamInstaller.exe`. *(See above if it doesn't start.)* |
| **2** | Choose which programs and games to scan. *All installed Steam, Epic and Ubisoft games are detected automatically.* |
| **3** | If you picked a Steam game, wait while SteamCMD is downloaded and installed. *Usually quick; depends on your connection.* |
| **4** | Wait while game info and DLCs are gathered and cached. *The first run can take a while if you selected many games with many DLCs.* |
| **5** | **CAREFULLY** select the games and DLCs you want to unlock. *No unlocker has been tested on every game.* |
| **6** | Decide whether to use **Koaloader**, and if so, choose a proxy DLL. *If the default `version.dll` doesn't work, see the [forum thread](https://forum.ubden.com.tr/konu/creaminstaller-auto-dlc-unlocker-installer-config-gen.1602/).* |
| **7** | Click **Generate and Install**. 🎉 |
| **8** | Click **OK** to close the program. |
| **↩️** | If an unlocker causes trouble, return to scene 5, select the games to revert, and click **Uninstall Selected**. |

> [!NOTE]
> CreamInstaller does **not** download or install actual DLC content. It installs DLC *unlockers* only. If a game doesn't already ship with its DLC files (many don't), you'll need to get them yourself. The relevant cs.rin.ru thread for the game is usually the best place to look.

## 🧰 Act IV — Behind the Scenes

<details>
<summary><b>🏗️ Building from source</b></summary>

<br/>

**Requirements**
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) or later (SDK 10.x also works: `global.json` uses `rollForward: latestMajor`)
- Visual Studio 2022+ with the *.NET desktop development* workload, **or** VS Code with the C# extension

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ubden/CreamApi-CreamInstaller.git
cd CreamApi-CreamInstaller
dotnet build CreamInstaller/CreamInstaller.csproj -c Release
```

**Publishing a single-file build** (the same command the release workflow runs):

```bash
dotnet publish CreamInstaller/CreamInstaller.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 \
  --self-contained false -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o publish/
```

> CreamAPI's `steam_api.dll` / `steam_api64.dll` are **not** distributed in this repository. To embed CreamAPI, place them in `CreamInstaller/Resources/CreamAPI/` before building. Without them the build still succeeds, but the CreamAPI unlocker option is unavailable in that build.
